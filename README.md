shpool-stats
============

I play pool every day at lunch and stats need to be had about that.

This is literally the least interesting repo there is, unless you're me or the 3 people who watch this pool game. It's basically two of the [sheetsee.js](https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js) demos combined in one (if you can figure out how I can sneak a map in here, you win 10 points), on top of my own spreadsheet. 

Please don't fuck with that spreadsheet. It tracks srs bizness like how much I cheat in said pool games (hint: I cheat a lot)
